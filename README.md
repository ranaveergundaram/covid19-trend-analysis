This project, COVID-19 Virus Trend Analysis, focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 case trends at both global and country levels using real-world data.
I used the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset, which is a widely trusted and reliable source.
First, I collected the dataset and loaded it using Python libraries like Pandas. Then I cleaned and preprocessed the data to make it suitable for analysis.
After preprocessing, I analyzed trends for a specific country and also compared COVID-19 trends across multiple countries. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I plotted multiple countries on the same graph, which made it easy to compare growth patterns.
One key insight from the analysis was that different countries experienced peak growth at different times, and seasonal changes also had a significant impact on the trends.
